## Acceptance criteria

- The vacancy to be posted concerns (front-end) web development;
- We accept vacancies for both permanent employment and freelance assignments;
- The vacancy must always contain the name of the ultimate company where the job seeker will end up;
- We strongly recommend including clear salary indications in the vacancy;
- We reserve the right to refuse vacancies without giving reasons;
- We do not keep statistics of the vacancies regarding the number of views.

## Cost

- Posting a vacancy costs €150. The costs of a freelance assignment are € 75. Both amounts are exclusive of VAT;
- Posting a vacancy for an internship is free;
- When placing more than 5 vacancies per calendar year, the sixth and later vacancies receive a 50% discount;
- The invoice for the job posting will be sent to the contact person by e-mail after publication;
- Fronteers uses a payment term of 30 days.

## Method & placement

- You can add a vacancy using the form. To add a vacancy we need some information, such as company name, billing address, contact person and an email address;
- After approval by e-mail, you can e-mail the vacancy text and any images;
- It's possible to place the vacancy in both English and Dutch. You need to provide both translations;
- The text can contain headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, links and (contact) forms; these are presented in the Fronteers house style;
- After approval of the text, the vacancy will be prominently placed on the website for 30 days;
- All available vacancies are shown on [our job board](/en/jobs/) in the order they were added;
- All available vacancies are shown on the Fronteers homepage in the order they were added;
- All vacancies are posted on our social media channels (Mastodon, Bluesky and LinkedIn), with a link back to the site;
- After 30 days, the vacancy remains online in our archive, if desired with a message that this concerns an old or already filled vacancy.

## Lead time

- The placement of the vacancy takes place by volunteers. You explicitly agree that placement may take several days as a result;
- Certainly in busy periods (eg around the conference) pressure to speed up this process is not appreciated.
