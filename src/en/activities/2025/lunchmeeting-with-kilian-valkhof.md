Friday April 11th is the day! The first Fronteers lunch meeting, with Kilian Valkhof.

The lunch meeting is an online meeting during lunch that you can follow from behind your desk
(but also from your couch or in the park).

The guest, in this case Kilian Valkhof (@Kilian@mastodon.social), talks about a certain
topic (this time **Dialog from a to z**) and afterwards you can discuss/chat about it.

The meeting starts at 12:30. Both the presentation and the discussion will be held in Dutch.
